## Load Cottier et al. data downloaded from OSF

Show available files

```{r readData, echo=FALSE}

# https://osf.io/s4aqg https://osf.io/s4aqg/files/am9bu
datadir <- here("publishedMotnPostnDataToLoad","osfstorageForCottierEtAl2023","Data","Effect files")
list.files(datadir)

```

Show the component fields of each MATLAB file from Cottier et al. 2023

```{r readData, echo=FALSE}

mat_files <- list.files(
  datadir,
  pattern = "\\.mat$",
  full.names = TRUE
)

for (f in mat_files) {
  cat("\nFile:", basename(f), "\n")
  
  mat <- readMat(f)
  
  # component names delimited by $
  cat(paste(names(mat), collapse = " $ "), "\n")
}

```

Get the individual session files

```{r readData, echo=FALSE}

mat_files <- list.files(
  datadir,
  pattern = "\\.mat$",
  full.names = TRUE
)

extract_sessions <- function(matfile) {
  mat <- readMat(matfile)
  nms <- names(mat)
  
  sess_vars <- nms[
    str_detect(nms, "(Sess1|Sess2|S1|S2)$")
  ]
  
  tibble(
    file = basename(matfile),
    variable = sess_vars,
    data = map(sess_vars, ~ mat[[.x]])
  )
}

session_data <- map_dfr(mat_files, extract_sessions)

head(session_data)
```
Combine all illusions listed in session_data into one big tibble

```{r}

all_illusions <- session_data %>%
  mutate(
    illusion = str_extract(file, "^[^_]+"),
    session = case_when(
      str_ends(variable, "Sess1") | str_ends(variable, "S1") ~ 1,
      str_ends(variable, "Sess2") | str_ends(variable, "S2") ~ 2
    )
  ) %>%
  select(illusion, session, data) %>%
  mutate(
    participant = map(data, ~ .x[, 1]),
    value       = map(data, ~ .x[, 2])
  ) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest(c(participant, value)) %>%
  relocate(illusion, participant, session)


```

Confirm it worked by recreating Figure 2 of Cottier et al. 2023, the scatterplot of each illusion.

```{r}


```

MIPS "participants used the keyboard to adjust the horizontal position of the two pairs of Gabors such that they were vertically aligned. Participants completed 60 trials, comprising 20 trials for each of the three different starting offsets."

FLE: 4 staircases
LUM-FLE: 4 staircases, "Participants used the keyboard to report which of the two circles was darker at the moment of the flash"
Frohlich (FE): 4? staircases, "Participants used the keyboard to indicate whether the rod was pointing to the left or right of vertical at its onset"
FD: staircaes, "Participants used a keyboard to report which flash was higher."
TG: staircases
FJ: Method of adjustment, Participants completed 51 randomly presented experimental trials, of which the first 3 were practice trials, and 3 were attention checks that occurred every 15 trials.
FG: "participants used the mouse to report the perceived location of the red target on the annulus. When participants did not see the target, they reported this by clicking on the fixation point."

Load FDE

```{r readData, echo=FALSE}

FDE <- readMat(
  file.path(datadir, "FD_Values.mat")
)

FDE$FD.PSE.Effect.Sess1

FDE$FD.PSE.Effect.Sess2



```


Load FLE
```{r ,echo=F}
FLE <- readMat(
  file.path(datadir, "FLE_Values.mat")
)

overallOfBothSessions<- FLE$FLE.Overall
overallOfBothSessions<- as_tibble(overallOfBothSessions)

sess1JoV<-  as_tibble(FLE$FLE.Sess1)
sess2JoV<-  as_tibble(FLE$FLE.Sess2)

```

Give data better column names

Each has three columns: participant number, Column 2 is pixels column 3 is dva

```{r , echo=FALSE}

sess1JoV <- sess1JoV %>%
  rename(
    ID     = V1,
    pixels = V2,
    dva    = V3
  )

sess2JoV <- sess2JoV %>%
  rename(
    ID     = V1,
    pixels = V2,
    dva    = V3
  )


```



## To-Do:

Once we get the staircase-level data (I think there are multiple staircases per session), we can have multiple observations per session and run the whole test on the second session . Because we noticed that the illusion tends to be smaller in the second session, presumably because of practice with the task helping the temporal binding/sampling. But there isn't a big reason to do that.

- Get the data for the other illusions and run the model on each of them

- Analyse the effect of session and test the hypotehsis that the FLE is smaller for certain illusions with more temporal component such as FLE 

- Sanity-check by doing my biasing dummy-coding hack to get the quid library to work with this one-condition data
